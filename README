SYNOPSIS
        use Finance::Bank::SuomenVerkkomaksut;

        # Creating a new payment
        my $tx = Finance::Bank::SuomenVerkkomaksut->new({merchant_id => 'XXX', merchant_secret => 'YYY'});
        $tx->content({....}); # All content in accordance to http://docs.verkkomaksut.fi/ field specs
        # set to 1 when you are developing, 0 in production
        $tx->test_transaction(1);

        my $submit_result = $tx->submit();
        if ($submit_result) {
            print "Please go to ". $tx->url() ." $url to pay your order number ". $tx->order_number().', see you soon.';
        } else {
            die 'Failed to generate payment';
        }

        # Verifying the payment when the user returns or when the notify address receives a request
        my $tx = Finance::Bank::SuomenVerkkomaksut->new({merchant_id => 'XXX', merchant_secret => 'YYY'});
        my $checksum_matches = $tx->verify_return({
                ORDER_NUMBER => $c->req->params->{ORDER_NUMBER},
                TIMESTAMP => $c->req->params->{TIMESTAMP},
                PAID => $c->req->params->{PAID},
                METHOD => $c->req->params->{METHOD},
                RETURN_AUTHCODE => $c->req->params->{RETURN_AUTHCODE}
        });
        if ($checksum_matches) {
            # depending on the return address, mark payment as paid (if returned to RETURN_ADDRESS),
            # as pending (if returned to PENDING_ADDRESS) or as canceled (if returned to CANCEL_ADDRESS).
            if ($url eq $return_url) {
                &ship_products();
            }
        } else {
            print "Checksum mismatch, returning not processed. Please contact our customer service if you believe this to be an error.";
        }

  verify_return
        When the end-user has completed the payment he will return to your specified RETURN_ADDRESS,
        CANCEL_ADDRESS or PENDING_ADDRESS. Before you process the returning any further you must
        check that the parameters given to this address have the correct checksum.

        This sub verifies the checksum and returns true or false stating if the checksum matched or did not.

        After you know that the checksum matched you can mark the payment as paid (if returned to RETURN_ADDRESS),
        as pending (if returned to PENDING_ADDRESS) or canceled (if returned to CANCEL_ADDRESS).

        Also the NOTIFY_ADDRESS should call verify_return first to verify the checksum and only then proceed with
        the information received in the NOTIFY_ADDRESS.

SECURITY
        Don't allow user to set the test_transaction to true! If the user can set it to true when returning he
        will get his payment registered as processed.

        Don't allow user to set the 'type' parameter of verify_return.
